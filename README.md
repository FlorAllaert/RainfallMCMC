========

A modular MCMC driver designed for computationally intensive likelihood functions.

Purpose
-------

My astrophysics research uses Bayesian methods, and I require a powerful and flexible MCMC driver. 

Features
--------

- Modular design: Likelihood calculation and other functions are dynamically linked
- Suite of output functions: Produces histograms, contour plots subsamples, and 
- Portability:. No dependency on external libraries
